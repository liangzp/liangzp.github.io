# 👨‍🎓 About Me
I am pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I'm supervised by [Prof. Jiheng Zhang](https://reijz.github.io/research/), Head of IEDA and Full Professor in IEDA and MATH. I received my Bachelor of Management degree from Lingnan College and my Bachelor of Mathematics from Mathematics School, Sun Yat-sen University in 2020. I am broadly interested in developing sample-efficient and computationally efficient policy learning algorithms for data-driven decision making problems, by leakaging tools from statistics and optimization. I am keen in photographgy, travel and learning languages.
